Quick Sort Algorithm is called as in place Algorithm

In place algotrithm means that the is no additional space used
Hence, Space Complexity : O(1)
Time Complexity: Worst Case - O(n2)
                 Average Case - O(nlogn)

Quick Sort is the most preferred sorting algorithm and is hence used  in built in functions of CPP STL.

It is preferred over Merge Sort as it is in-place sorting algorithm.
